	abstract = {Recently, a Newton’s iterative method is attracting more and more attention from various ﬁelds of science and engineering. This method is generally quadratically convergent. In this paper, some Chebyshev-type methods with the third order convergence are analyzed in detail and used to compute approximate inverse preconditioners for solving the linear system Ax = b. Theoretic analysis and numerical experiments show that Chebyshev’s method is more effective than Newton’s one in the case of constructing approximate inverse preconditioners.},
